Short project description (recommended size: between 200 and 400 words) - 

This product is a service that allows clients who upload API keys for their LLM’s to
receive feedback on security vulnerabilities. The website portion will have a user-friendly UI
that securely and easily allows them to login, upload API’s, and download PDF’s. Within a
client server architecture we will have our website talk to a jailbreaking library that provides
accurate measures of each kind of security issue after a series of tests. With a database to
store the values between these two systems our product will provide a continuous user flow. A
novel piece of this project is a watermarking system for the LLM’s that will provide the users an
example of watermarked LLM’s and what benefits that will provide.
